## Instructions

Flow of Deployment 


![Diagram of deployment](image/azure-devops-framework.png?raw=true "Diagram of deployment")

* Project running on Azure App Service

* Project cloned into Azure Cloud Shell
![All tests passed](image/azure-cloud-shell.png?raw=true "Test Passed")

* Passing tests that are displayed after running the `make all` command from the `Makefile`

![All tests passed](image/passing-tests-min.gif?raw=true "Test Passed")

* Output of a test run

![Locust Tests](image/locust_test.png?raw=true "Test Passed")

* Successful deploy of the project in Azure Pipelines.

![Successful deploy](image/successful-deploy-azure-pipeline.png?raw=true "Successful deploy")

* Azure Panel

* Running Azure App Service from Azure Pipelines automatic deployment

![Completed with Success azure pipelines](image/azure-pipeline.png?raw=true "Completed with Success azure pipelines")

* Successful prediction from deployed flask app in Azure Cloud Shell.
The output should look similar to this:

## Enhancements

At future we can improve building time with an image installed pandas, it need a huge time to download and install.

Include better tests

Include realtime Service monitoring
